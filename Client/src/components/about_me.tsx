                I am a Y11 student that is godly at programming. I starting
                teaching myself when I was 7 and slowly got better and better
                over the years. I hate doing HTML and CSS, which is why I use
                Tailwind and React to write everything for me. I really enjoy
                coding and thats why I still continue to do it to this day.
