        I starting teaching myself to program when I was 7 and slowly got better
        and better over the years. I hate doing HTML and CSS, which is why I use
        Tailwind and React to write everything for me. I really enjoy coding and
        thats why I still continue to do it to this day. I am still currently a
        pre-pre-grad student.
